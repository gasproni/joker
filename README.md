### Joker, an http J(son) (br)oker

This is a simple middleware framework for java. It is based on Json and http, and allows the specification of interfaces between client and servers using only Java, without the need of an interface definition language or anything like that.

It is at the very early stage, so there are still some bugs, and the configuration possibilities are quite limited. To see how it works, have a look at the example in the examples directory.
